# Focal points
## Change the the receiving doctor at any time
When the receiving doctor has been assigned, the focalpoint cannot change the receiving doctor anymore. This causes problems if the receiving doctor does not answer, or if some other reason this needs to change. At anypoint the focal point should be able to change that?

# Recieving doctor 
## Notify that the patient really came
We could add a functionality that the patient really came, and close the case at this time. Maybe we need to notify if he never came?

## Notify focal point of sending country
The focal point of the sending country should get notified that a patient is leaving the country. No name necessary, but it is important for coutry stats. This could happened at the last step (sending discharge) of the process (case B)

# Long form
## hidden fields
Hidden fields should have a display:none property set by default and not be hidden by javascript as when the connection is slow, people start answering and then when the page is loaded "ready" the fields disappear. This is bad user experience. 

# All
## dashboard(s)
### Status
Case closed -> Feedback sent, cased closed
### sorting
add the possibility to sort by date, status, etc in order to find a case faster.

### Submited vs recieved
visually separate either into two tables the cases that you sent and those that you received or with a color etc.

## View the sending country
We need to add the information of the sending country/city in the views of the focal point as they need this information for statistics and other reports.

## View the name of the patient
In certain countries this information is needed for the focal point as well.

## review data 
before submitting forms users have suggested to add a review step as they had some issues with scrolls, when scrolling to find a country, they have selected a wrong country. As far as we cannot reasign cases, change the form etc, the case get lost...

# Management of users
1. The countries need to be displayed in the list of users and we should be able to filter by countries.

# Alert WHO
We need to alert the WHO if nothing happens on a case after 3 working days

# Emails/Contact
We should find a way for the doctors to be able to communicate between themselves. For example in case B, the receiving doctor might want to ask something to the sending doctor, how can he do this as he does not have any contact information.
