# Questions
## Case B
1. The issue was raised that focal points need to know the name of the person. As they need to follow up in their country databases. How do we manage this with other countries that do not or CANNOT have this info for confifentiality reasons. 

## Case C
1. The name of the patient is not sent to anyone. The doctor who is writing the report puts in the name, but no one gets it. Why? 
2. It was suggested during the meeting that, we should add an option for submitting a C case from another case. The aim is to save time.

## Case D?
If a foreign patient dies, this case would help to find the family, the person responsible to pay for the burial, or where to send the body.
